# COBRAS: Classes and Objects By Reapplying Array Structures

COBRAS is a compiler written in Rust for Snake, our self-created functional programming language. The language is small, fast, and mainly for daily use. Type checking is mainly done dynamically. Static type checking is also implemented with varification and synthesis.

The language supports:
- Arithmetic Operations 
    * Add
    * Sub
    * Mul
- Logic Operations
    * And
    * Or
    * Lt
    * Gt
    * Le
    * Ge
    * Eq
    * Neq
    * Not
- Type Operations
    * IsBool
    * IsNum
    * IsFun
- Branch Control
    * If
- Value Setting
    * Let
- Array
    * ArraySet
    * ArrayGet
- Function and Closure
    * MakeClosure
    * CallClosure
- Class, Object, and Method
    * ClassDef
    * MakeObject
    * MethodDef
    * CallMethod
    * SetField
